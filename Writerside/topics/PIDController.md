# PID Controller: The Conductor of Motion

[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER: A graph showing the effect of each PID component (P, I, D) on the system response. Include examples of good and bad tuning.]

## Overview

The PID controller acts as the conductor of our mechanical systems, taking position inputs and producing precise motor control signals. It processes movement in the following sequence:

1. **Input Processing**
   - Takes current position and target position
   - Calculates error based on the shortest path to target
   - Considers any obstacles that may affect movement direction

2. **Control Signal Generation**
   - Applies PIDF coefficients to generate control effort:
     - P term: Directly proportional to current error
     - I term: Accumulates error over time to eliminate steady-state error
     - D term: Based on rate of error change to dampen oscillations
     - F term: Feedforward term for system-specific compensation
   - Constrains final output to valid motor power range (-1.0 to 1.0)

3. **Output Application**
   - The calculated motor power is applied to the system
   - Creates a feedback loop where the new position becomes the next input

## Component Roles

| Component | Role | Effect |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Proportional | Immediate Response | Quick initial movement |
| Integral | Error Correction | Eliminates steady-state error |
| Derivative | Damping | Prevents overshooting |
| Feedforward | System Compensation | Counteracts system-specific forces |

## Implementation

The PIDF calculation is performed as follows:
```kotlin
integral += (error * Dt)
val derivative = (error - prevError) / Dt
prevError = error

val controlEffort = ((derivative * params.kd + 
                     integral * params.ki + 
                     error * params.kp) + ff)
                   .coerceIn(-1.0, 1.0)
```

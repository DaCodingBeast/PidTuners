# Mathematical Simulations

## Why should we simulate?
In order to provide the particles with an understaning of their performance, we have ot be able to model or caclulate the loss of each particle, given its parametrs f(x)

Running 1000 of times is not feasible, need an efficient method


## What information does it need?


We have to both get predefined variables on the system

Motor type

We have to empirically test to find mecahinism charactersitics



### Arm Mechanism

Rotational Inertia of System
Friction Constants
Gravity Constants

Equations - find in arya canva

Empirical tests:
Videos of Graden TODO
Videos of Arya

### Linear Slide mechanism

Mass of Slides - special mention of not having the user actually measure mass
Friction Constants

Equations


Empirical tests:

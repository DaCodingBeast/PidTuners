## The Challenge of PID Tuning

PID controllers are fundamental to robotics and automation, offering precise control over dynamic systems. However, traditional PID tuning is notoriously time-consuming, often requiring hours or even days of manual adjustment and testing.

## Our Solution: Automated PID Tuning

To address this challenge, we developed an automated approach to PID tuning that minimizes physical robot interaction. After extensive research, we identified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as our solution. PSO has proven successful in industrial applications, with companies like FIXME: Toyota, BMW, and Tesla

using similar approaches for optimizing their robotic manufacturing systems.

## The Power of Mathematical Simulation

A crucial component of our system is our custom-built mathematical simulation of the robotic arm. This sophisticated model accurately represents the complex physics and dynamics of the arm, allowing us to evaluate PID parameters without physical testing. This mathematical feat enables us to:

- Predict arm behavior under different control parameters
- Calculate precise torque and motion characteristics
- Validate performance before physical implementation

## How It All Works Together

Our system combines three key components:

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization**: An intelligent algorithm that efficiently searches for optimal PID parameters
2. **Mathematical Simulation**: Our custom-built model that accurately predicts arm behavior
3. **PID Controller**: The control system that uses the optimized parameters

## The Challenge

Picture a robotic arm reaching for an object. As it moves, it battles against gravity, fights friction, and must maintain precise control. This is the challenge we solve through our advanced simulation and optimization system.

## The Forces at Play

### 1. The Gravity Tango
Gravity is the constant dance partner of our robotic arm. Its influence changes with every angle:

To find the gravity torque equation, we use a quadratic fit approach. The gravity test function measures the DC motor torque (TODO: through this relationship) required to hold the arm at various angles. By collecting data points across different arm positions and applying quadratic regression, we can derive the following equation:

Gravity Torque = a*(armAngle +b) -k (a b and k are all constants)

This allows us to know how much torque gravity is applying at all times

### 2. The Motor's Power
Our motors are the heart of the system, converting electrical energy into mechanical motion:

```math
τ_motor = Kt * I
```

Where:
- Kt: motor torque constant
- I: current

### 3. The Friction Waltz
Friction is the subtle resistance that must be overcome:

```math
τ_friction = b * ω
```

Where:
- b: friction coefficient
- ω: angular velocity

## The Simulation Canvas

### The Time Step Dance
Each moment in our simulation is a carefully choreographed sequence:

    A[Current State] --> B[Calculate Net Torque]
    B --> C[Determine Acceleration]
    C --> D[Update Velocity]
    D --> E[Update Position]

```

### The PID Conductor
Our PID controller acts as the conductor of this mechanical orchestra:

| Component | Role | Effect |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Proportional | Immediate Response | Quick initial movement |
| Integral | Error Correction | Eliminates steady-state error |
| Derivative | Damping | Prevents overshooting |

## The Motor Library

Our comprehensive FTC motor library is like a well-organized music sheet:

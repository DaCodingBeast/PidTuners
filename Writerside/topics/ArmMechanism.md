Picture a robotic arm reaching for an object. As it moves, it battles against gravity, fights friction, and must maintain precise control. This is the challenge we solve through our advanced simulation and optimization system.

## The Physics of Motion

To understand how our arm moves, we need to trace the chain of calculations from position to the forces that cause motion:

### 1. Position → Velocity → Acceleration
The fundamental relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration in rotational motion:

- `theta = theta_0 + ∫omega dt`
- `omega = omega_0 + ∫alpha dt`

Where:
- `theta`: Current angle position
- `omega`: Angular velocity
- `alpha`: Angular acceleration
- `theta_0`, `omega_0`: Initial conditions

### 2. Acceleration → Net Torque
The angular acceleration is determined by the net torque and the system's rotational inertia:

- `alpha = t_net / I`

Where:
- `alpha`: Angular acceleration
- `t_net`: Net torque on the system
- `I`: Rotational inertia (determined through testing)

This matches the code in `ArmSim.kt`:
```kotlin
val angularAcceleration = torqueApplied / motor.systemConstants.Inertia
```

### 3. Net Torque Components
The net torque is the sum of all torques acting on the system:

- `t_net = t_motor + t_gravity + t_friction`

Let's break down each component:

#### a. Motor Torque
The motor's torque is calculated from its power characteristics. We use our [Motor Library](MotorLibrary.md) to obtain the necessary motor constants.

- `t_motor = DC_motor_power * (realistic_RPM / theoretical_RPM) * stall_torque`

Where:
- `DC_motor_power`: Power supplied to the motor
- `realistic_RPM`: Actual RPM under load
- `theoretical_RPM`: No-load (theoretical) RPM
- `stall_torque`: Maximum torque at zero speed (from Motor Library)

This formula reflects how available torque decreases as RPM increases, and how real-world performance differs from theoretical maximums.

#### b. Gravity Torque
Gravity torque is modeled as a quadratic function of arm angle, based on empirical data and curve fitting:

- `t_gravity = a * (angle^2) + b * angle + c`

Where:
- `angle`: Arm angle (in radians or degrees, as fitted)
- `a`, `b`, `c`: Empirically determined constants from gravity torque testing

This approach captures the nonlinear relationship between arm angle and the torque gravity applies, which is especially important for arms with non-uniform mass distribution or complex geometry.

#### c. Friction Torque
Friction is determined empirically by analyzing the relationship between the theoretical (no-load) RPM and the actual RPM under load:

- `friction = function(theoretical_RPM, real_RPM)`

By comparing the drop from theoretical RPM to real RPM, we estimate the frictional losses in the system. This data-driven approach allows us to model friction more accurately than using a simple constant coefficient.

Where:
- `theoretical_RPM`: The motor's no-load speed
- `real_RPM`: The observed speed under load

## The Simulation Loop

Each time step in our simulation follows this sequence:

1. Calculate all torque components
2. Sum to find net torque
3. Calculate angular acceleration
4. Update angular velocity
5. Update angular position

This is implemented in the `updateSimulator()` function in `ArmSim.kt`:
```kotlin
val torqueApplied = motorTorque + gravityTorque
val angularAcceleration = torqueApplied / motor.systemConstants.Inertia
velocity += angularAcceleration * Dt
target = AngleRange.fromRadians(
    AngleRange.wrap(target.start + velocity * Dt),
    target.stop
)
```

## The PID Conductor

Our PID controller acts as the conductor of this mechanical orchestra, taking inputs from the arm simulation and producing precise motor control signals. The arm's position error is calculated using the AngleRange utilities and fed into the PID controller, which then generates appropriate motor power commands.

For the arm mechanism specifically:
- The error calculation considers the shortest angular path to the target
- The feedforward term is calculated based on the arm's angle to counteract gravity
- The PID controller outputs motor power that is then used to calculate the motor torque

For detailed information about the PID controller's operation, see the [PID Controller](PIDController.md) topic.
